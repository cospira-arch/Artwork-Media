Artwork & Media — Overview（英語）
Artwork & Media

Conceptual Exploration and Public Interface

The Boundary OS project is not limited to academic or policy discourse. It is accompanied by a parallel body of artwork and media experiments that function as exploratory interfaces between theory, perception, and lived experience.

These works serve three purposes:

Translation
Complex ideas—such as boundary permeability, affective escalation, and non-dominant AI mediation—are translated into visual, auditory, and interactive forms that can be intuitively grasped without technical expertise.

Provocation
The artworks intentionally surface tensions between control and openness, security and trust, automation and agency. They are not illustrative decorations, but conceptual stress-tests for the Boundary OS philosophy itself.

Public Engagement
Through video essays, generative visuals, and experimental simulations, the project invites dialogue beyond academic and governmental circles, including artists, technologists, and civil society.

Media formats may include:

Conceptual diagrams and generative figures

Short-form videos and lectures (YouTube, talks)

Written reflections and essays (note, blogs)

Interactive simulations and speculative interfaces

Together, these elements form a cultural layer of Boundary OS—one that acknowledges that boundaries are not only legal or technical constructs, but also perceptual and narrative phenomena.
